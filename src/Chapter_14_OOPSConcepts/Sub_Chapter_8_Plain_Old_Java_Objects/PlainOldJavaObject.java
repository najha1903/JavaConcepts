/*
   POJO CONCEPTS

   i)   A plain old Java object acronym POJO is a class that has boilerplate codes for instance fields, getters, setters, and constructors to get, update, set data
   ii)  It's used to house data and pass data between functional classes.
   iii) It usually has no other, or very few methods, other than getters and setters for the instance fields.
   iv)  Many database frameworks use POJO's to read data from, or to write data to databases,files or streams.
   v)   Examples :- i)   A POJO also might be called a bean or a JavaBean.
                  ii)  A JavaBean is just a POJO with some extra rules applied to it.
                  iii) These rules are in place so that Java frameworks have a standard way to manipulate and manage these objects.
                  iv)  A POJO is sometimes called an Entity because it mirrors database entities.
                  v)   Another acronym is DTO for Data Transfer Object. It's a description of an object that can be modeled as just data.
